How to write simple recursive functions?


Step 1. Functionality and Name
	"drawFigure"


Step 2. Arguments - Necessary Information
	1) The three points of triangle p1, p2, and p3;
	2) The level:
		level = 1: a simple triangle without any sub-triangles 
		level >= 2: a triangle formed by three subranges with (level - 1)
	3) The canvas:
		The triangles will be drawn on the canvas. Google for its APIs.
	4) public void drawFigure(int level, Canvas g, Point p1, Point p2,Point p3){}


Step 3. The simplest case - level = 1.
	if (level==1) {
		//call g.drawLine() for three times to draw three line segments that form a simple triangle
	}


Step 4. A more complex case - level = 2.
	if (level==2) {
		int newLevel = 1;
		// count the three points of each fractal triangle
		// call drawFigure(newLevel, g, ...) for three times to draw three sub-triangles
	}


Step 5. General cases - level > 1
	Modify the code of step 4 to deal with all cases.


Step 6. First call to recursive funtion
	Line 65:	drawFigure(5, canvas, p1, p2, p3);
