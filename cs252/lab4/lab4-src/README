thr1.cc:
The program ends up printing their own independent function call from its independent stream.
"A" corresponds to t1(Thread 1)
"B" corresponds to t2(Thread 2)
"C" corresponds to te main thread
"D" corresponds to t3(Thread 3)
"E" corresponds to t4(Thread 4)

All of these are independent of each other, and are infinitely printing their corresponding character.
The characters are printed out in random order as each thread is calling the printf function as soon as it's printf function returns, thus seeming random.

thr2.cc:
The function printC gets called in the main thread and goes into an infinite loop. The 2 threads are never actually created in the main thread thus have no output.
