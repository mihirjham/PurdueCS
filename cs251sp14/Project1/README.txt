Programs & their compilation instructions:
All the programs can be compiled as the handout asks it to, as all the files are provided in the folder that is being submitted.

/other/ Folder:
I have provided a folder in the project folder called other/
This folder has the following:
	-All of the input files from the handout that was used to test the program.
	-A PNG Image of the graph generated by the results from NumberOfCalls
	-A results.txt file which contains all of the results from NumberOfCalls used to generate the graph.
	-A script file to run the NumberOfCalls with input as 1-200.
