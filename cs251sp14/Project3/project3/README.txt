Compiling instructions:
All files compile as expected. KeyValue.h and KeyValue.cc are 2 files that
have been added. These are needed for symbol.cc to work. The Makefile has
been modified to compile and run these as needed.

Features:
All the tasks in the lab handout have been completed.
symbol.cc will ONLY work with a unique table input. It will not work
otherwise.
In key.cc, keyShow() and keySubsetSum() functions has been modified. These do
not show the corresponding decimal and binary values.
